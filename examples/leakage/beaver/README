Algorithm:
Multiplying two secret shared values using Beaver triples.

Dafny:
I am not sure how to express the randomness of the beaver triples, and possible values computed from them, in terms of leakage...

EasyCrypt:
Show that, for a uniformly random value a and a constant value x, x - a is also uniformly random.
